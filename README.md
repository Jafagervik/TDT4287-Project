## TODOS
- [] Setup Makefile
- [] Setup suffixtree 
- [] Add some simple procedures to traverse tree

### Tasks 1
- [] Read from file
- [] Build Suffixtree from all lines in file
- [] Find all suffixes in S that is a prefix in a, return amount
- [] Length of distribution after removal of adapter fragments
- [] Asymptotic and practical runtime of algorithm    

### Tasks 2
- [] Allow mismatch of 10% between matching s and a
- [] Allow mismatch of 25% between matching s and a
- [] Allow insertions and deletions
- [] Asymptotic and practical runtime of algorithm    

Brute force: alignment 
For ins/dels: use GA

### Tasks 3
- [] Estimate rate of sequencing errors per sequence
- [] Estimate rate of sequencing errors per nucleotide
- [] Find out if this is uniformly distributed

### Tasks 4
- [] TBD
### Tasks 5
- [] TBD

### Report
- [] Write report
